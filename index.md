Hi, I`m laercioskt and this is some notes.

I`ll use this space to make some notes and practice english, so the majority of the content will be in english.

## About Me

My name is Laércio Pereira, I`m a GO/Baduk/Weiqi player from Brazil, and sportsman who likes to skate and play soccer.

I work as coordinator of development together with teams building software that lasts.

I really like to talk, even though a little shy, and usually I`m looking for things that could be done with family and friends.
